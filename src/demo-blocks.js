The difference is that discounted cash flow takes into consideration the value of future cash flow.

If crypto only replaces currency, then the market cap is around ~10s of T. If it replaces all financial products, the value could be much much higher. Some estimates put the value of the derivatives market at 1.2 Quadrillion (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp). Why are the sums of financial products greater than the sums of currency? The main reason is because people are making bets on bets on bets. For example, let's say I bet that the Golden State warriors will win the NBA Championship. A second person may make a bet that I win my bet and so on.

Ideally it would also service as examples for the steem api which would make the lives of other steem developers easier. \n\n- Technology Stack\n\nThe technology stack is fairly simple. Everything is contained within a single html page: javascript, css, html. Github pages is used to host the simple tool. If there's any sort of desire for it, I would be up for adding something like webpack and heroku hosting. \n\n- Roadmap\n\nMy plan is to create more simple displays and examples of how to use the steem api.

If you make a mistake saying the number you have to repeat it (until you say it correctly). This would magnify the impact of numbers with more syllables because there is a higher probability you mess them up and they take longer to say.\n\nLet's say for the sake of simplicity, you have a 95% of saying any syllable correctly. If a word has 6 syllables, then the probability of saying correctly is `(.95)^6 ~= 74%`. \n\nTo properly model the time of mistakes, you should use a Markov chain but for simplicity, let's say the expected value of a mistake is one third of the number of syllables in the word (if you wanted to do this more precisely, you would model this as a Markov chain and find the static distribution to calculate the expected value).\n\nSo this would mean for our 6 syllable word, the takes `6 * .74 + (2 + 6) * .28 * .74 +  (2 + 2 + 6) * .28 * .28 * .74 + ... ~= 7`. So our 6 syllable word is more like 7 syllables because some times you mess up and have to say it again.\n\nWhat about one of these 15 syllable words? Well `.95^15 ~= 46%` If we run through the process as described above, we get:\n`sum (15 + 5*n) * .46 * .54^n from n = 1 to n = infinity  ~= 14` plus the initial term `15 * .46  = 6.9`\n\nThus a 15 syllable word is more like `6.9 + 14 = 21` syllables. By my logic, any number you put into that calculator will be a significant understatement.\n\nThese are the problems and some potential improvements for this analysis:\n- Model the mistakes better as a Markov Chain\n- You could add game theory analysis such that if you knew you were more likely to make a mistake on a high-syllable number, you could say it more slowly to a point where you would minimize your expected time of saying it.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"technology\"],\"app\":\"steemit/0.1\"}"}]}],[374,{"trx_id":"e44b76aa8f6bd88a2f55026953b25c6d23467ae8","block":20223997,"trx_in_block":68,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-27T02:00:09","op":["vote",{"voter":"egmracer01","author":"crispycoinboys","permlink":"how-long-does-it-take-to-count-to-1-million","weight":10000}]}],[375,{"trx_id":"49ad57cda153a6132ed4839d4acbf6a421d9b6df","block":20224012,"trx_in_block":20,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-27T02:00:54","op":["comment",{"parent_author":"egmracer01","parent_permlink":"re-trevorgeorge-re-egmracer01-re-trevorgeorge-playing-with-code-a-little-time-spent-in-coder-heaven-20180227t012700557z","author":"trevor.george","permlink":"re-egmracer01-re-trevorgeorge-re-egmracer01-re-trevorgeorge-playing-with-code-a-little-time-spent-in-coder-heaven-20180227t020052844z","title":"","body":"thanks for that.

Ideally it would also service as examples for the steem api which would make the lives of other steem developers easier. \n\n- Technology Stack\n\nThe technology stack is fairly simple. Everything is contained within a single html page: javascript, css, html. Github pages is used to host the simple tool. If there's any sort of desire for it, I would be up for adding something like webpack and heroku hosting. \n\n- Roadmap\n\nMy plan is to create more simple displays and examples of how to use the steem api. Ideally, the features could lead to a more complicated and focused app. \n\n- How to contribute?\n\nPlease file issues on github or contribute by opening a pr against the repo. I'm pretty responsive and would appreciate any feedback.\n    \n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@egmracer01/generate-a-word-cloud-for-any-account\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"utopian\",\"app\":\"utopian/1.0.0\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"repository\":{\"id\":122585177,\"name\":\"steemit-cloud\",\"full_name\":\"evanmarshall/steemit-cloud\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/evanmarshall/steemit-cloud\",\"fork\":false,\"owner\":{\"login\":\"evanmarshall\"}},\"pullRequests\":[],\"platform\":\"github\",\"type\":\"development\",\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"design\",\"stats\"],\"users\":[\"dan\"],\"links\":[\"https://evanmarshall.github.io/steemit-cloud/\",\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmVyPeVjvGr7mRQPg86dTvYTyKcffR26V6cnmWY6Vdh96K/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-22%20at%2011.17.49%20PM.png\",\"https://github.com/evanmarshall/steemit-cloud\",\"https://www.dlive.io/#/video/egmracer01/16b7dfd9-1812-11e8-991c-0242ac110002\",\"https://www.dlive.io/#/video/egmracer01/1c35cd64-181b-11e8-991c-0242ac110002\"],\"image\":[\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmVyPeVjvGr7mRQPg86dTvYTyKcffR26V6cnmWY6Vdh96K/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-22%20at%2011.17.49%20PM.png\"],\"moderator\":{\"account\":\"codingdefined\",\"time\":\"2018-02-27T07:59:37.359Z\",\"reviewed\":true,\"pending\":false,\"flagged\":false},\"questions\":[],\"score\":0}"}]}],[388,{"trx_id":"8e69c0bc22243c5c08e9c0bc2b968761d9b8384c","block":20231041,"trx_in_block":39,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-27T08:00:00","op":["comment",{"parent_author":"egmracer01","parent_permlink":"generate-a-word-cloud-for-any-account","author":"codingdefined","permlink":"re-egmracer01-generate-a-word-cloud-for-any-account-20180227t075959624z","title":"","body":"Thank you for the contribution.

If I wanted recommendations from other users, I would just accept the fact that up votes or some kind of crowd indicator. Of course, we know by looking at Trending and Hot that it's a broken measure. It clearly doesn't work.\n\nBut more importantly, the opinion of other users has nothing to do with my opinion. The whole idea here is that individuation is far more effective at bringing me things that I will like than looking at what other people like and assuming that they are like me.\n\nThe Netflix recommendation system starts with a basic assumption that your registered preferences are representative of what you really want. Then they look at the registered preferences of other people and try to find the ones that are nearest to your express preferences in their fairly limited measure space. Then they look for things which other people have found desirable who are near you in preference space, check against whether you've seen it and rated it, and go from there.\n\nThe reason that they use the intermediary of other people's preferences is because they don't have the technology, processing power or time that it would take to directly find features in movies that you have rated preferably. Image processing, audio processing – those are hard problems. It's much easier and less data intensive to look at the information which is easy for them to acquire, expressed ratings and preferences.\n\nWe don't actually have that problem. We could, if we wanted, create an eigenvector which describes the up vote tendencies based on word frequency of any individuals' history. Then we could find the distance in our vector space of interesting words between those up vote tendencies.\n\nBut that wouldn't really be useful for actual discovery. It would only be useful for the discovery of content which someone else has already found and up voted.\n\nI want to go the opposite direction. I want to be able to take a new post which no one has actually seen before and compare it to the eigenvector which describes the things I have historically liked in order to determine if this new piece of content is something that I might like. No amount of information from other people will actually make that more possible. Quite the opposite. It would only pollute the signal of my preferences.\n\nAgain, I am working actively to avoid and impositional process which originates on the system. I don't want the system to tell me what other people like, I want the system to be able to look at content and filter it for the things that I might like.\n\nSo far today I've managed to extract from the database my likes for an arbitrary period of time in the past, extract the text of those posts and comments, process them into word frequency lists, and I'm now preparing them to go into some kind of semantic analysis – but this is where things start getting hard.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"technology\"],\"app\":\"steemit/0.1\"}"}]}],[427,{"trx_id":"835b29757e1b9fe5be3fc32bb380433f22ed7792","block":20256258,"trx_in_block":9,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-28T05:01:00","op":["comment",{"parent_author":"egmracer01","parent_permlink":"re-lextenebris-re-egmracer01-re-lextenebris-programming-beginning-the-search-for-discovery-20180228t034718913z","author":"lextenebris","permlink":"re-egmracer01-re-lextenebris-re-egmracer01-re-lextenebris-programming-beginning-the-search-for-discovery-20180228t045945627z","title":"","body":"@@ -2421,17 +2421,16 @@\n avoid an\n-d\n  imposit\n","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"technology\"],\"app\":\"steemit/0.1\"}"}]}],[428,{"trx_id":"679139e943e5fb4d52a27276dcf550820d8fb9aa","block":20256261,"trx_in_block":24,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-28T05:01:09","op":["vote",{"voter":"lextenebris","author":"egmracer01","permlink":"re-lextenebris-re-egmracer01-re-lextenebris-programming-beginning-the-search-for-discovery-20180228t034718913z","weight":2000}]}],[429,{"trx_id":"41904c8a0bd0f93512e315af86d333971db5a50d","block":20256263,"trx_in_block":27,"op_in_trx":0,"virtual_op":0,"timestamp":"2018-02-28T05:01:15","op":["comment",{"parent_author":"bbilgin","parent_permlink":"re-egmracer01-using-sentiment-analysis-to-analyze-how-positive-or-negative-your-steemit-account-is-20180227t181859685z","author":"egmracer01","permlink":"re-bbilgin-re-egmracer01-using-sentiment-analysis-to-analyze-how-positive-or-negative-your-steemit-account-is-20180228t050115261z","title":"","body":"I think that's a great idea and another steemian is also thinking about it.

I understand that you don't want to base the recommendations based on other users. \n\nI do think you need a specific way to characterize your feature vector though. N-grams is one way but it can blow up the dimensionality really quickly. You'll also have to think about how you want to handle images and other media. Do you also want to include some features representing the profile of the person voting? \n\nI would also be careful of creating your own filter bubble. Maybe create two models: one for maximizing the expected value of a recommendation and another for maximizing the maximum value of a set of recommendations .
